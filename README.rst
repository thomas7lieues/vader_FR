from vaderSentiment_fr.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

SIA = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

phrase = "Une phrase très cool à analyser"


score = SIA.polarity_scores(phrase)

>>>>>>> a2bbbaa7bea95f96d7384471871c7836cdedc0a2
print(score)

## Output : {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.275, 'compound': 0.2247}



# Note : You can use polarity_scores_max instead of polarity_scores. polarity_scores_max uses fuzzywuzzy to get the most similar words with your inputs. For example "connar" won't be detected with polarity_scores but with polarity_scores_max
